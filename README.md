Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script watch_next.py.
Create a text file named movies.txt in the same directory. Each line in this file should be in the format "Title: Description" for each movie.
Modify the hulk_description variable in the script with the description of the movie you've watched.
Run the script using the following command:
python watch_next.py
The script will analyze the descriptions and recommend the next movie to watch based on similarity.
